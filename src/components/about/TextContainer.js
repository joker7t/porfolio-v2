				Iâ€™m Toan Nguyen - a Web developer in Axon Active Vietnam.
				<br />
				I have over 2 years of developing web applications. I am working as a Full-stack developer for projects
				about fintech and e-commerce. My experience includes MySql, Postgres, MongoDB, Java, JSF, Spring,
				Javascript, Node JS, React JS, Nginx, Docker. I love to make websites not only have an attractive and
				clear design but also have a high performance.
				<br />
				Besides technologies, I believe the way to create products also plays a major role in quality. that's
				why Kanban and Scrum process mean a lot to me. Familiar with them helps me bring the highest quality
				products with full requirements to customers.
				<br />
				Last but not least, I am a self-learner. Keep updating is the principle that I never forget. I am
				interested in learning new things to upgrade myself day by day. Facing and going over the impediments is
				my destination.
